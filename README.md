Company-quotation By Kasemdet Soommart

The web application has mostly four pages in terms of functionality. 

The user can sign in on the main page. 

The quotation page follows, allowing the user to create a new quotation directly from the form by inputting the item, price, and quantity. The data returned from the products collection is the item and price. The user picks an item from a drop-down menu, and the price is automatically calculated from the database. The user just enters an amount and clicks save, and the information is saved in MongoDB's quotation collection.

The product management page, which is linked to the product collection and allows you to add, update, and delete new goods, is the third tab. 

The quote management page is the final page, and it shows a list of items that have been saved in the quotation collection. The date, item name, number, price, amount, and total amount of all items show in a table. The date entered determines the order of the item. In addition, the user may add more quotes by clicking the create quote button, which will send them to the create-quotation page.
